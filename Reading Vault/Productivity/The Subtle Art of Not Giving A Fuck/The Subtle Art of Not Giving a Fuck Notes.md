# What is this book about?

- It's okay to *suck* sometimes

>"Developing this ability ( not giving a fuck about everything ) leads to something I like to think of as a kind of '**practical enlightenment**'"

<p align="center" style="color: red">"<em>that no matter what you do; life is comprised of <strong>failures, loss, regrets and even death</strong></em>"<br>After all, the only way to <em>overcome</em> pain is to first learn how to <strong>bear</strong>it</p>

<p align="center" style="color: lime;">This book will <strong>NOT</strong> teach you how to gain or achieve, but rather how to lose and let go... It will teach you to <em>not try</em></p>

#### What is the American Dream?

It is a man who fights for what he wants, never gives up, and eventually achieves his wildest dreams.

>It is practically a movie to happen

#### A bit on Charles Bukowski

>[!info]- What is the meaning of Epitaph?
>A phrase or form of words written in memory of a person who has died, especially as an inscription on a tombstone

Even thought Charles did become a novelist and achieved his dreams; it is strange to see that on his tombstone, the epitaph reads: "*Don't try.*"

- Despite the book sales and fame, Bukowski was a **loser**. *He knew it*.
- His success stemmed not form some determination to be a winner, by from the fact that he *knew* he was a loser, **accepted it**, and then wrote **honestly** about it.

>His comfort with himself as a failure

>*Be comfortable with failing ( a lot )*

- **Fame** and **Success** didn't make him a *better* person. Not was it by becoming a better person that he became famous and successful

<p align="center" style="color: red;">Self Improvement <span style="color: white;">&#8800;</span> Success</p>

>After all, no truly happy person feels the need to stand in front of a mirror and recite that she's happy. She just *is*

>"The smallest dog barks the loudest" a *saying* in Texas

>*This is similar to that photo of a Cheetah v/s other animals; it knows it is the fastest; so she **does not** need to show it.*

>Why? My guess: because giving a *fuck* about more **stuff** is good for **business**

- The problem is that giving to many *fucks* is **bad** for your **mental health**

### The Feedback Loop from Hell

>[!info]- What is the meaning of Batty?
>Mad; insane

>Or you're so worried about doing the right things all the time that you become worried about how much you're worrying. Or you feel so guilty for every mistake you make that you begin to feel guilty about how guilty you're feeling. Or you get sad and alone so often that it makes you feel even more sad and alone just thinking about it. - The Feedback Loop from Hell

>[!info]- What is the meaning of Cogent?
>( of an argument or case ) clear, logical and convincing

#### Social Media is the Fucking Problem

Our problem is with the "*social media*" society today, this thing of "*hey-look-my-life-is-cooler-than-yours-social-media*" is created many **more** *negative* experience upon us.

##### Past v/s Present

- Back in Grandpa's day, he would feel *shit* and think to himself, "Gee whiz, I sure do feel like a cow turd today. But hey, I guess that's just life. Back to shoveling hay."

- Now if you feel *shit* for even 5 minutes;
	- You are attacked by a billion of images where people are having the time of their lives.
	- It makes it impossible to **not** feel like there's something wrong with you.

<p align="center">We feel bad about feeling bad<br>We feel guilty for feeling guilty<br>We get angry about getting angry<br>We feel anxious about feeling anxious<br><em>What is wrong with me?</em></p>

<p align="center" style="color: lime;">This is why <strong>not giving a fuck</strong> is so key</p>

>We have so much fucking stuff and so many opportunities that we don't even know what to give a fuck about anymore

>*Because there are a number of **infinite** things to give a fuck about*

<p align="center" style="color: green;">The desire for more positive experience is itself a <em>negative</em> experience. And, paradoxically, the <strong>acceptance</strong> of one's <em>negative</em> experience is itself a <strong>positive</strong> experience</p>

The above $\uparrow$ is also know as the "*Backwards Law*" by [[The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck Notes#Alan Watts| Alan Watts]]

>"You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking of the meaning of life" Albert Camus

or more simply "*Don't Try*"

>[!note] *Just Don't Try to be that thing*
>Ever notice that sometimes when you care **less** about something, you do better at it? Notice how it's often the person who is the **least** invested in the **success** of something that actually ends up achieving it?
>- That's what the *Backwards Law* is!

Being open about the bad things about yourself will make you close to people; and you will be **more** *confident* and *charismatic* around others

>*This is one advice to keep - be bad; be yourself, be stupid*

<p align="center">Everything worthwhile in life is won through <strong>surmounting</strong> the associated <em>negative experience</em></p>

<p align="center">The avoidance of suffering is a form of suffering<br>The avoidance of struggle is a struggle<br>The denial of failure is a failure<br>Hiding what is shameful is itself a form of shame</p>

>[!info]- What is the meaning of Inextricable?
>Impossible to disentangle or separate

>If you are **able** to **not** give a *fuck* about **pain**, you will become ***unstoppable***

>You have a limited amount of *fucks* to give. Very **few**, in fact. And if you go around giving a fuck about everything and everyone without conscious thought or choice $\rightarrow$ Well, then you're going to get *fucked*! :)

### The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck

>[!warning] A person who finds no *emotion* or *meaning* in anything $=$ PSYCHOPATH

#### Subtlety 1: Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being *comfortable* with being different

>There's no such thing as not giving a fuck. You must give a fuck about something

We need to ask the questions:

- What do we give a fuck about?
- What are we choosing to give a fuck about?
- How can we not give a fuck about what ultimately does not matter?

>[!info]- What is the meaning of Indignant?
>Feeling or showing anger or annoyance at what is perceived as unfair treatment

>[!info]- What is the meaning of Pariah?
>1. The outcast
>2. [ Historical ] a member of an indigenous people of southern India originally functioning as ceremonial drummers but later having a low caste

<p align="center" style="color: red;">The willingness to stare failure in the face and <strong>shove</strong> your <em>middle finger</em> back at it</p>

<p align="center" style="color: green;">The point is to find the <em>shit</em> you enjoy dealing with</p>

#### Subtlety 2: To not give a fuck about adversity, you must *first* give a fuck about something **more important** than adversity

>[!info]- What is the meaning of Berate?
>Scold or criticise ( someone ) angrily

>I once heard an artist say that when a person has **no** problems, the *mind* automatically find a way to **invent** some.
>I think what most people - especially *educated, pampered middle-class white people* - consider "*life problems*" are really just side effects of not having anything more important to worry about

>[!info]- What is the meaning of Frivolous?
>1. Not having any serious purpose or value
>2. ( of a person ) Carefree and superficial

#### Subtlety 3: Whether you realise it or not, you are always choosing what to give a fuck about

<p align="center" style="color: yellow; font-style: italic;">We realise how little attention people pay to the <strong>superficial</strong> details about us, and we choose not to obsess so much over them</p>

>"**Maturity** is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what's truly *fuckworthy*" $\rightarrow$ I means that's a quote

>[!info]- What is the meaning of Wart?
>A small, hard, benign growth on the skin, caused by virus

>We no longer need to give a fuck about *everything*.
>Life is just what it is. We accept it, warts and all.
