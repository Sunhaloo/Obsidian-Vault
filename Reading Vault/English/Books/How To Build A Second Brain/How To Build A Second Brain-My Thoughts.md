## Introduction - The Promise of a Second Brain

Yes, I have tried to remember many things, 

- Important or non-important
- When trying to argue with someone and you forget the **one** important thing
- Things that you have listened, watched or read from; 

I listen to and watch a lot of people like

- Ali Abdaal
- Smarter Every Day
- Gaming Tutorial Videos 
- Computer Optimisation and Linux Videos

I realised that I cannot absorb these information being given to me passively. I always feel like that I need to be at my table with a pen and a piece of paper. That why I have decided to change this by reading this book.

In addition, *"The only problem is that you're often consuming it at the wrong time"* .
This is **very true** for me personally. I am addicted to my phone and things that will not serve me anything productive in my life. I hope that after reading this book; I will change.

**Writing Things Down** is a very simple and easy task, yet it has a **big** impact on out daily lives. 

The Building A Second Brain System will teach me how to:

- **Learn** and **relearn** subjects/articles/posts more effectively
- **Organise** a system that will make my life easier 
- A place to **save** my ideas and thoughts and **not do it again**
- **Connecting** ideas together 
- **Reliable** method of **sharing** my work with others
- Have more time to myself as I know where items/things are kept.

Instead of just looking/using technology as a form of **entertainment**. We could use **technology** as a method to get our shit together and make us *productive*.

With the *"Second Brain"* it allows one to **recall** things from the **past** as you have *written* them down in your organisation system;
I think that it is similar to the **Zettelkasten** method by not quite

> *"At the same time, those who continue to rely on their fragile biological brains will become ever overwhelmed by the explosive growth in the complexity of our lives"*

That is a bold statement; what I can deduce from that is:

- This method really works
- The **benefits** of the Second Brain overweighs it's initial use and setup.

To be honest, in this competitive ( and corrupt ) world we live; whatever it might be - Playing a game, being the best student/athlete. We need to find every little things to gain an edge on our opponents.

## The Foundation - Understand What's Possible

## Where It All Started - Chapter 1

A very nice quote from David Allen. 

His medical problem relates to me very much. As my father has gone through many problems as well. 

- From getting diagnosed with Lupus in 2008 to
- Getting infection on his titanium hip and having to open/do surgery 3 times on the same leg.

I thought that only in Mauritius that they cannot for God's sake diagnose a patient to find his or her medical problems.

### **Discovering the *Power Of Writing Things Down***

So basically, he was at another doctor's office waiting. He then had a revelation of writing everything that happened to him with his medical problems. He even asked the receptionist to get **all** his medical records.
He took those *medical records* and then scanned then into his computer which could be:

- Searched
- Rearranged
- Annotated
- Shared

Thus he took **control** of his own health. 

As the quote goes:

> "Health is wealth. Peace of mind is happiness. Yoga shows the way." Vishnudevananda Saraswati

> "My _notes_ were as **important** in finding the relief as any medicine or procedure. My notes were a **practical medium** for turning any _new information_ into **practical solutions**." [[Tiago Forte]]

- Really important, as we all **say** that we are going to do this or that; but rarely put our words into actions.

The **Second Brain** can combat

- Short Attention Span 
- Poor Grades ( *if you put in the work - NOT by magic* )

> **You can imagine when I graduated from college with a nearly *straight-A grade point average and university honors**.[[Tiago Forte]] 

He then got a peaceful life of a **teacher** in rural Ukraine before coming to work as an **analyst** for a small firm in San Francisco.

- The change of pace was brutal but again, he **wrote everything done**
	- By everything he means:
		- Conversation
		- Clients
		- Social Media
		- Research Papers

> I remember looking around at my colleagues and wondering, *"How can anyone get anything done here? What's their secret?"* [[Tiago Forte]]


- YES I DO, very good feeling I must say so. 

We need a **dedicated place** to *store the all the information* that we have gathered. So that it can be:

- Sorted for later use
- Shared across/to multiple media/devices/people

Thus, we can gain a sense of confidence in finding the information we need.

### **Discovering the Power of *sharing***

> I learned from one of the reports we published that the value of physical capital in the US- land, machinery, and buildings for example - is about **$10 trillion** but that value is dwarfed by the total value of human capital, which is estimated to be 5 to 10 times larger

Human capital includes 

- The knowledge and the knowhow embodied in humans
	- Their education, their exprerience, their wisdom, their skills, their relationships, their  common sense, their intuition
