## Introduction - The Promise of a Second Brain

How often have you tried to remember something important and felt it slip through your mental grasp?

- When you were having:
	- A conversation
	- A fact to support your point of view
	- Conceived a brilliant idea but evaporated when you've reached your destination
	- Useful takeaway from a book or article you have read in the past

We are flooded with **more** advice than ever promising to make us:

- Smarter
- Healthier
- Happier

How many of the great **ideas** we've had or encountered have faded from out minds before we even had a chance to put them into **practice** 

- This is book is dedicated to changing that. ==The only problem is that you're often consuming it ( *contents* ) at the wrong time==


To be able to make use of information we value, we need a way to package it up and **send it through time** to our *future self*. 

- It all being with a simple act of **writing things down**

- **Connect** ideas and notice patterns across different *areas* of your life so you know how to live better
- Adopt a reliable system that helps you **share** your work more confidently and with more ease
- Turn work *"off"* and **relax**, knowing that you have a trusted system keeping track of all the details
- Spend **less** time *looking for things*, and more time doing the best, most creative work you are capable of

We need to look at **technology** as *"a tool for thinking"*
Technology can **enhance** our cognitive abilities and **accelerate** us towards our goals

The *"Second Brain"* is other called:

- Personal Cloud
- Field Notes
- External Brain

In Short; it is a **digital archive** that stores your information about your *private* and *public* life

### His Medical Case History ( In Brief )

- Went to family doctor, went to more specialised doctors
	- But all arrived at the same conclusion
		- "there's nothing wrong with you"
- Pain started getting worse and worse
	- Had trouble speaking or swallowing 
	- Began to take very powerful anti-seizure medication
		- Temporarily relieved the pain but had a lot of side effects like
			- Numbing sensation around the whole body
			- **Severe** short-term *memory loss*
		> "I was a a twenty-four-year-old with the **mind** of an *eighty-year-old*"
- His ability to express himself continued to deteriorate - my discouragement turned into despair

### **A Personal Turning Point - Discovering the *Power Of Writing Things Down***

One day, when he was sitting at another doctor's office. He had an [[Definitions ( How To Build A Second Brain )| epiphany]]. 
He decided that he could take his responsibility for him own health and treatment.

So he took out his journal and began to **write** what he was *feeling* and *thinking*. He wrote about:

 - His condition
 - The treatments that he had not undertaken and undertaken
 - What he wanted and didn't want
 - What he was willing to sacrifice and what he wasn't

As he wrote out, he knew what he needed to do. He went to the receptionist and asked about his complete patient record ( which was more than 100 pages ). He **scanned** them and put them on this computer where they can be turned into *digital records* and could:

- Searched
- Rearranged
- Annotated
- Shared

He became the project manager of his health. With all of this information at his disposal, **patterns** began to emerge. After that, he found out what works best for him and managed to fight the disease.

>Continuing with lifting directly from the book.

My *notes* were as **important** in finding the relief as any medicine or procedure. My notes were a **practical medium** for turning any *new information* into **practical solutions**. 

In the *digital [[Definitions ( How To Build A Second Brain )| realm]]*, information could be molded and shaped and directed to any purpose like a magical, [[Definitions ( How To Build A Second Brain )| primordial]] force of nature.

I had always been a mediocre student with average grades.

- Early school teachers would regularly send me home
	- Reporting of short attention span and wandering mind

**You can imagine when I graduated from college with a nearly *straight-A grade point average and university honors**.

Now working as a **teacher** with few resources and little support in eastern *Ukraine* countryside. My notetaking system once again became my lifeline. 
I saved examples of lessons and exercises anywhere I found them: from textbooks, websites, etc. I mixed and matched English phrases, expressions and slang into word games to keep my energetic third graders engaged. I taught older students the basics of personal productivity

- How to keep a schedule
- How to take notes in class
- How to set goals
- How to plan their education

After 2 years of service as a teacher, he returned to the US and landed a job as an **analyst** at a small firm in San Francisco. Even though excited to work. He face major difficulties:

- Pace of work was **[[Definitions ( How To Build A Second Brain )| frantic]]**
- Received hundreds of emails, 
- Every hour filled with dozens of messages
- Pings and dings from every device

Merged into a *ceaseless melody of interruption*

I remember looking around at my colleagues and wondering, *"How can anyone get anything done here? What's their secret?"*

I knew only one trick, and it started with **writing things down**
I started using a notetaking app on my computer. 

Took notes during: 

- Meetings
- Phone calls
- While doing online research work
- Wrote down facts [[Definitions ( How To Build A Second Brain )| gleaned]] from research papers
- Wrote down feedback from more experienced colleagues

I created a **dedicated place** on my computer for the information related to it; where I could sort through it all and decide on a plan of action.

- Gained a sense of confidence in my ability to **find exactly *what* I needed *when* I needed.**

> "You know the feeling of satisfaction when you are the only one in the room who remembers an important detail?"
