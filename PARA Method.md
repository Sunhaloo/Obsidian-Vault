# What is the PARA?

It is a framework to organise your messy life!

## What does it stand for?

It stands for **Projects**, **Areas**, **Resources**, **Archives**

# Projects

It is any outcome requires multiple work session to complete

Think of it like necessary tasks that needs to be completed or *projects* like notes, documentation that needs to be done ( by a certain time )

### Features of **Projects**

- Have goals
- Have a deadline

Projects are **action-oriented** meaning that requires the most amount of *brain-power* to complete.

### Examples of Projects:

- Reorganising Notes / House / Writing Note
- Planning Vacation

# Areas

It has a **role** / **purpose** that needs to be **maintained** *over time*.
It is an on-going *life process* that needs to be continually maintained

## Feature

- They are **never** *really* completed
- They do **not** have a deadline

### My Examples are:

- Confidential Folder
- *Could* be learning vault

# Resources

Ahh, now I get it, *resources* are any ongoing interest / hobbies that you do.

This means like:

- My Documentations
- After Doing Learning Vault
	- I could put the in **Resources Folder**
- Reading Vault
- Media Vault / Folder
	- Images, Videos, Pictures

# Archives

They are more like storage. Keeps **inactive** *projects*.

Nowadays, there is no reason to delete things these days.

It could be a **mixture** of *Projects*, *Areas* and *Resources*
