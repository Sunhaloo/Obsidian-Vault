# Linking Python Files

## Why am I Doing This?

So that, in the *graph view*, I get to link all related **python** files.

# Syntax

- [[Python Language]]
- [[String Manipulation - Python]]

# Arrays

- [[Arrays - Python]]

# Functions

- [[Functions and Procedures - Python]]

# Sorting Algorithms

- [[Insertion Sort - Python]]
- [[Bubble Sort - Python]]

# Searching Algorithms

- [[Linear Search - Python]]
- [[Binary Search - Python]]

# Abstract Data Types

- [[Stack ADT - 1D Array]]
- [[Queue ADT - 1D Array]]
- [[Link List ADT - 1D Array]]

# Random Program Codes

```dataview
TABLE Tag, Status, Type, Date
FROM "Learning Vault/A-Levels/Computer Science/Programming Languages/Python/Random Program Codes ( Python )"
WHERE file.name != "Python Data View"
SORT file.name ASC
```

## Why am I Doing This?

So that, in the *graph view*, I get to link all related **python** files in one place.

### Files:
