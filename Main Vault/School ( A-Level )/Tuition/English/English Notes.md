# Format of a Paragraph

- Derminination and indominable spirit is vital for success

**Evidence:**

A phrase he used in that speech acquired a cult status, often repeated and inspiring many up to this day

    "King Saint", his people adopted that dream, eventually and the world adopted that dream of justice and equality

    When the US elected its **first** *black* president, it was the culmination of Kings's dream

# How to Prepare for the GP Essay:

## 1.Reading

[Ben Jonson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Jonson), 17th century English Writer said:

"For a person to write well, there are 3 requiered necessities:

1. To read the best authors/writers
2. To observe and listen to the best speakers
3. Do much exercise of your own, it is fit for a beginner and a learner to study others and the best"

**Report:** A key to success to *General Paper* is without doubt "reading"

You need to read and understand to be able to: Use the knowledge you have gain to support your views arguments, claims in your writings

### Example:

- Television does more harm than good. Is this a fair comment?

*Agree:* 

**Claim:** Watching violence on television, often makes the viewers agressive themselves and tend to make them glamourise violence

**Evidence:** [Robert Liebert](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Robert_Liebert), US Child Physcologist observed that children coming from perfectly good families may turn violent as a result of the small screen. He futher added that TV teaches violence and young people learn from it. 

**Example To Support Evidence:** In the UK, 2 young boy of age 12 years old and 13 years old kidnapped an 8 year old boy in a supermarket. They killed the yound boy and threw his body on the railway line. Upon investigationm it was found out the young criminals were influenced by violent cartoons they had watched on TV

## 2. Setting Up a Purpose For Your Reading

When you are watching a movie, the first 15 minutes are critical; as they will determine whether you will continue watching or give up and do something more worthwhile.

Without a purpose, you can quickly loose interest. So you have to **set goals** for your *reading*. You should know *what* you are reading, underline *why* and *how* it will **help** you

### Example:

- Press Article on Education

Education is too vast. You must understand what precisely:

- What the press article is all about?
- Aim about education
- Poor education system

In this way, reading will be both **helpful** and **interesting**.

## 3. What You Need To Read:

## Newspapers

- [lexpress.mu](https://lexpress.mu)
- [le mauricien](https://www.lemauricien.com)
- [TopFM](https://www.topfm.mu)

Update your knowledge of current national/international events. Example:

- National papers ( like [lexpress.mu](https://lexpress.mu) and more ) daily publishes all the important national events like crime, road accidents, sports events in the country and etc. Sometimes they will also publish international events that are booming in the specific that country.

**You need such knowledge of such events in your G.P essay**

Example: What are the obstacles hindering progress in your country?

1. Corruption ( [ICAC](https://www.icac.mu) )
2. Discrimination ( social, gender ( sex ), race )
3. Econimic Mismanagement ( Audit Report )

> [Jack Kilby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Kilby)

Example 3:

The man who singled handedly showed the world that without violence much can be achieved.

> [Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi)

### Example Paragraph ( Magazines Example 3 ):

In a world plagued by violence, Gandhi brought a new philosophy, non-violence to show to the world that **violence** achieve nothing but *ugliness*. When Gandhi started agitating for the independence of India, he chose a slogan, a maxime ( *meaning: greatest* ) which is "Non-Violence"; in Hindi, "Ahimsa"and he never swerved an inch away from it. While following this principle Gandhi also underwent many hunger strikes which was a self-punishment. He called this "Passive Resistance" ( *"[satyagraha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyagraha)"* ). History bears evidence that Gandhi was right because he succeeded in bringing about the independence of India by using this principle. Today Gandhi is a respected figure loved and admired by friends and enemies alike.

## Documentaries

### Example Paragraph ( Documentaries ):

>[!warning]
>The essay title is missing!
>But we are "For/Agree" with the argument of the essay 

In a BBC documentary entitled "prostitution in Bangladesh". It shows how young girls and women are kidnapped from poor villages and bought as sex slaves in the district of *["Daulatdia"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daulatdia)*. The whole issue of prostituition in Bangladesh is a big political hyprocrasis. The government does not legalise it yet it tolerate for obvious reasons. In the meantime, the victims suffer from [sexually transmitted infection ( STI )](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_infection), because either they are ignorant of it or prostituition does not flourish if the women asked for protected sex.
