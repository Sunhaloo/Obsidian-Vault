# What is General Paper?

As the name implies, *General Paper* is a multi-faceted subject that *derives* material from a wide range of disciplines such as **Social Science** ( Economics, Sociology, Politics ) and **Pure Sciences** ( Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Biology )

## Preparing For The General Paper 

### Reading

> Report States: "A key to success to GP is withouth doubt, reading"

You need **evidence** to *support* your views in each paragraph of the essay you write.
Without evidence, your reader will **not** accept your arguments.

We need:

- Examples
- Quotations
- Figures
- Facts

This will only be acquired with reading and reading all types of information from everywhere.

### Example 1:

This is a simple, easy *looking* essay, but you need to adopt an advanced approach as for any essay

>[!note]
> Remember you need **evidence**, i.e, you **cannot** write on your own as you did in SC Level


# Format of a Paragraph

**Topic Sentence:**

- What does success bring to means
- Strong willpower that has lead many seemingly people to achieve unbelievable success.
- Derminination and indominable spirit is vital for success

**Evidence:**

1. During the [American Civil Rights Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement). [Martin Luther King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.), made a famous speech. A phrase he used in that speech acquired a cult status, often repeated and inspiring many up to this day

    "King Saint", his people adopted that dream, eventually and the world adopted that dream of justice and equality

    When the US elected its **first** *black* president, it was the culmination of Kings's dream

2. Obama in his campaign gave another charismatic slogan, 

> "Yes We Can" [Barack Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama)

**Concluding Sentence:**

- It was a firm determination of such people that led them to success despite their meagre means. ( willpower and dermination )

>Where will you find these 2 names and 2 quotations?
>By **Reading**

# How to Prepare for the GP Essay:

## 1.Reading

[Ben Jonson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Jonson), 17th century English Writer said:

"For a person to write well, there are 3 requiered necessities:

1. To read the best authors/writers
2. To observe and listen to the best speakers
3. Do much exercise of your own, it is fit for a beginner and a learner to study others and the best"

**Report:** A key to success to *General Paper* is without doubt "reading"

You need to read and understand to be able to: Use the knowledge you have gain to support your views arguments, claims in your writings

### Example:

- Television does more harm than good. Is this a fair comment?

*Agree:* 

**Claim:** Watching violence on television, often makes the viewers agressive themselves and tend to make them glamourise violence

**Evidence:** [Robert Liebert](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Robert_Liebert), US Child Physcologist observed that children coming from perfectly good families may turn violent as a result of the small screen. He futher added that TV teaches violence and young people learn from it. 

**Example To Support Evidence:** In the UK, 2 young boy of age 12 years old and 13 years old kidnapped an 8 year old boy in a supermarket. They killed the yound boy and threw his body on the railway line. Upon investigationm it was found out the young criminals were influenced by violent cartoons they had watched on TV

## 2. Setting Up a Purpose For Your Reading

When you are watching a movie, the first 15 minutes are critical; as they will determine whether you will continue watching or give up and do something more worthwhile.

Without a purpose, you can quickly loose interest. So you have to **set goals** for your *reading*. You should know *what* you are reading, underline *why* and *how* it will **help** you

### Example:

- Press Article on Education

Education is too vast. You must understand what precisely:

- What the press article is all about?
- Aim about education
- Poor education system

In this way, reading will be both **helpful** and **interesting**.

## 3. What You Need To Read:

1. Newspapers

**Example:** 

- [lexpress.mu](https://lexpress.mu)
- [TopFM](https://www.topfm.mu)
- [Defimedia](https://defimedia.info)
