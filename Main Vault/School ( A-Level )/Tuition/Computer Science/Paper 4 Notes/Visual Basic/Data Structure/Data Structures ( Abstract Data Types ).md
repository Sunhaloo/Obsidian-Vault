# What is an Abstract Data Type?

## From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type)

It is a **mathematical model** for *data types*. It is defined by its behavior [semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics_(computer_science)). 

Formally, an ADT may be defined as a "class of objects whose logical behavior is defined by a set of values and a set of operations...

## From My Notes

### What is An ADT?

Collection of **related** data items stored in memory which can **manipulated** by a number of **operations**

- Computing is about **handling data**
- Data need to be **organised** in a logical manner so that they can be **manipulated**
- Computer Science has developed a number of [[Data Structures ( Abstract Data Types )#Links To Data Structures: | data strutures]] to easily **manipulate** and **sort** data
- Related data means that there is a *"relationship"* of some kind between data items
