# Introduction to Abstract Data Types

- Computing is all about **handling** data.
- Data need to be **organised** in a *logical manner* so that they can be **manipulated**

Computer Science has developed a number of [data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) to easily **manipulate** and **sort** *data*. 
**Related data** means that there is a *relationship* of the **same kind** between data items.

# Cambridge Answer

>[!tip]- Abstract Data Type
> It is a *collection* of **related** data items stored in memory which can be **manipulated** by a number of *operations*

# What is an [Abstract Data Type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20an%20abstract,the%20behavior%20of%20these%20operations.)?

It is a **mathematical model** for data types. It is defined by its behaviour ( [sematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics_(computer_science)) ) for the point of view of a user.

We can manipulate and perform operations on the data.
We could also say that and **Abstract Data Type ( ADT )** is *defined as a class of objects whose logical behaviour is defined by a **set of values** and a **set of operations***

### Example:

Integers can be a form of ADT; as the a number of operations can be performed on data like:

- Addition 
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Greater and Less than

Nevertheless, typical integers are *represented* as **[binary numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number)**, **[2's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement)** or even **[binary-coded decimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal)**.
