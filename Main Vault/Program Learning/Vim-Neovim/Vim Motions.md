>[!warning]
>This will only work in **NORMAL** mode.

This is the equivalent to the arrow keys in other applications. But this is a better version as you do not need to lift your hand off the [home row](https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&hs=XS9&hl=en&sxsrf=AB5stBiQ41i5P7sfjZrKuF-CXrisrhjEjg:1689527220353&q=home+row+keyboard&spell=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj6v7qu25OAAxXSTqQEHS8IAfkQBSgAegQICBAB&biw=790&bih=859&dpr=1)

# How to Close Neovim/NvChad


To close we need to type the following:

```vim

:q

```

This will quit the Neovim/NvChad.
If you have opened for example: the file tree, to *close* **Neovim** we need to first exit the file tree and then quit Neovim

# Saving a File 

To save a file we need to type the following:

```vim

:w

```

The following folder will save the current file that you are working with in Neovim

In **NvChad**, we can also user *"Ctrl + S"* to save a file like other applications ( Notepad, Microsoft Word, etc  )

## Saving and Duplicating the Contents a File to Another File with a Different Name

If you have a file and it has some text in it, and you want to make another file with the same contents as the **original** file but with a **different** *name*; use the following command:

```vim

:w "file_name"

```

## Saving and Closing a File 

To save and quit a file at the same time, type the following 

```vim

:wq

```

## Quit Without Saving/Without Making Any Changes

To close a file **without** saving, we need to type the following:

```vim

:q!

```

This also works if we wrote something into the file and then realised that we did not need to write anything. By using the command above; the file will revert back to its original state.

# NvChad 

NvChad has a **cheat sheet** which can be accessed by pressing the leader key + ch  

>[!note] 
>The default **leader** key is *space* in NvChad

There you will find most used keymaps. Again these keymaps can be changed in the *.lua* files.
Please take a look at the cheatsheet because it has important things that you will want to use.

For example: Did you know that you can **find files** inside of *NvChad*
