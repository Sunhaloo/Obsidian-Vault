# The Box Model

The first important **concept** for you to be successful in [[CSS]]. *Skipping* this right now will cause much **frustration** down the line.

- Every single thing on a *webpage* is a **rectangular box** 
	- These boxes can have *other* boxes in **them**

To grasp this idea, you can add a border around everything, so that you can visually see what we are talking about those *rectangular boxes*

- Even **circles** are you know *circles*; but they fit together like **rectangular boxes**.

## Manipulating Size of *these* Boxes

To manipulate the sizes between them, we use: `padding`, `margin`, `border`.

To sum them up briefly;

- `padding`: Increases the **space** *between* the border of box and the content of the box
- `margin`: Increases the **space** *between* the borders of a box and the borders of adjacent boxes
- `border`: Add **space** ( *even if it's only 1px or 2px* ) *between* the margin and the padding
