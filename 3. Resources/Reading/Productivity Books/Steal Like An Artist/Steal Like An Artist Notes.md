# What is this book about?

This book is about how our ideas, thoughts and actions are **not** original. In a way, most things has been done before and we are just connecting the dots together so that we can make "*new*" ideas, thoughts...

# Notes

>When people give you advice, they're really just talking to themselves in the past

## Chapter 1: Steal Like an Artist

### How to Look at the World ( like an artist )

![[is stealing worth it.jpg|390x390]]

>It all comes back to seeing if you can take something from someone.

In my case, "*stealing*" some code from [devaslife](https://www.youtube.com/@devaslife) for his Neovim configuration or maybe "*stealing*" ideas on how to make Windows faster.

"*Everything is up for grabs. If you don;t find something worth stealing today, you might find it work stealing tomorrow or a month or a year from now.*"

>"The only art I'll ever study is stuff that I can steal from." David Bowie

### Nothing is Original

As the writer **Jonathan Lethem** has said that what people call "*original*" do not know where the original sources came from. Thus they think that *this work* is real deal.

- All creative work builds on what came before. Nothing is **completely** original

>"There is nothing new under the sun" ( Ecclesiastes 1:9 )

French writer André Gide puts it
>"Everything that needs to be said has already been said. But, since no one was listening, everything must be said again"

>"What is originality? Undetected plagiarism" William Ralph Inge

### The Genealogy of Ideas

>[!info]- What is Genealogy?
>A line of descent traced continuously from an ancestor.

![[read in between lines.PNG| 450]]

This means that you must be able to read **in between the lines**

Another example is **genetics**. You inherit some DNA from your *mother* and *father*; thus in a way, you are **not** unique and as Mr Kleon puts it:

>"You're a remix of your mom and dad and all of your ancestors"

#### Takeaway

Just as you have a familial genealogy, you also have a genealogy of ideas. You don’t get to pick your family, but you can pick your teachers and you can pick your friends and you can pick the music you listen to and you can pick the books you read and you can pick the movies you see. You are, in fact, a mashup of what you choose to let into your life. You are the sum of your influences

As the German writer Goethe said
>"We are shaped and fashioned by what we love"

>"We were kids without fathers... so we found our fathers on wax and on the streets and in history. We got to pick and choose the ancestors who would inspire the world we were going to make for ourselves." Jay-Z

### Garbage In, Garbage Out

>The artist is a **collector**. **Not** a *hoarder*! They collect things that they really love.

#### Economic Theory

If you take the incomes of you five closest friends and average them, the resulting number will be pretty close to you own income

>You are only going to be as good as the stuff you surround yourself with.

**Our job is to collect *good ideas***

>"Steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination. Devour old films, new films, music, books, painting, photographs, poems, dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light and shadows. **Select only things to steal that speak directly to your soul** ( "*this means that: do not let everyone control you!*" ) . If you do this, your work ( *and theft* ) will become **authentic**." Jim Jarmusch

#### Climb Your Own Family Tree

>"I don't believe in art. I believe in artists" Marcel Duchamp

>[!tip] How to Learn from your Inspiration
>- Chew on one *thinker* ( writer, artist, role model, scientist, ( *software* ) engineer ).
>- Learn everything you can about that one person that you love / inspire to become
>- After that, go ahead and find 3 people that your *thinker* liked
>- Now learn everything about these people that your *thinker* liked
>- RINSE and REPEAT

The thing about dead people, role models or remote masters is that they cannot denied you as your student as they *left* their **lesson plans** in their **work**.

1. Read **Deeply**
2. Stay **Open** ( *to ideas, new and weird / strange thoughts* )
3. Continue to Wonder
4. Google it Yo!
   >Always check you work. If you have an idea, "Google It", as it might have already be used, done, invented, etc!

### School Yourself

><p align="center" style="color: green">"School is one thing. Education is another"</p>
><p align="center" style="color: 
red">It's always <strong>your</strong> job to get yourself and education</p>

#### Tips to Get Ahead of Everyone Else

Look things up ( "*Google it Yo!*" ). Chase down every reference. **Go deeper than anybody else** - that how you will get ahead of people ( *quicker* )

>[!warning] Google EVERYTHING!!!

- Collect books, even if you don't plan on reading them right away

>"Nothing is more important than an unread library" John Waters

>Don't worry about doing **re**search; Just **search**

>"Whether I went to school or not, I would always study" RZA

### Save Your Thefts For Later

Yes, this I have to agree; information today comes into many way and in many forms; from a simple conversation to a tutorial on YouTube or a lecturer / professor talking about difficult concepts.

He recommends having a notebook and a pen with you wherever you go. This is **better**. But I think that with today's technologies and devices; *just use your smartphone*. You can type, you can record your voice / people's voice.

#### Swipe File

This is a file ( *also known as **morgue** file* ) where you can keep track of the ideas that you have "*stolen*" from other. Again, could be **digital** or **analog**.

>"See something worth stealing? Put it in the swipe file. **Need a little inspiration?** *Open the swipe file*"

>"It is better to take what does not belong to you than to let it lie around neglected" Mark Twain

## Chapter 2: Don't Wait Until You Know Who You Are to Get Started

### Make Things Know Thyself

>"*Go Make Things; ANYTHING!*"

The act of making things is how we are going to understand ourselves better and figure out what "*path*" we want to take in life.

<p style="color: green;" align="center"><em>You're Ready. Start making stuff</em></p>

- Imposter Syndrome: Scared to start; *very real things that runs rampant in educated people*

>[!info]- What is Phony?
>Not true, real or genuine.

### Fake It 'Til You Make It

>[info] Shakespeare in "*As You Like It*"
>All the world's a stage,
>And all the men and women merely players:
>They have their exits and their entrances;
>And one man in his time plays many parts.
>>[!note] Another Way to Say This
>>***Fake it 'til you make it'***

1. Pretend to be something you’re not until you are—fake it until you’re successful, until everybody sees you the way you want them to; or 
2. Pretend to be making something until you actually make something. I love both readings—you have to dress for the job you want, not the job you have, and you have to start doing the work you want to be doing.

>"You start out as a phony and become real." Glenn O'Brien

I think I know what he means; Look at Web Dev; You start out by *copying* other people successful website and cloning them; this will build your experience and when it is time for the real deal. You will be able to perform!

### Start Copying!

>"Start copying what you love. **Copy copy copy copy**. At the end of the copy you will find your self." Yohji Yamamoto

Nobody is born with a style ( *it has to be acquired* ). We learn by pretending to be our heroes ( *this might be in professional work, learning things, playing games* ).

>We learn by **copying**!

Remember we are *copying* to **learn** and not *plagiarism*.

Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOTycVw44Zo) to find more about in this video by Kesh.

<p align="center"><strong>Copying is about <em>Reverse-Engineering</em></strong></p>

<p align="center"><em>The human hand is incapable of making a <strong>perfect copy</strong></em></p>

Hence, we should aim for **Progress** instead of *perfection*

As [devaslife](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjOuCFrs584&t=258s) says: "Perfection is not the goal; but progress is"

>*Only one man was perfect in this World!*

>"Those who do not want to **imitate** anything, produce nothing" Salvador Dalí

>"If copy from one author, it's plagiarism, but if you copy from many, it's research." Wilson Mizner

> Gary Panter say, “If you have one person you’re influenced by, everyone will say you’re the next whoever. But if you rip off a hundred people, everyone will say you’re so original!

#### What to Copy?

Don't just steal their style;

- Steal their **thinking** behind the style

Because you do not want to ressemble like your hero, **you want to see like your hero**

### Imitation is Not Flattery

>"We want you to take from us. We want you at first, to steal from us, because you can't steal ( *I feel this one* ). You will take what we give you and you will put it in your own voice and that's how you will find your voice. And that's how you begin. And then one day someone will steal from you." Francis Ford Coppola

- **Imitation** is about *copying*. **Emulation** is when *imitation* goes **one step further**, breaking through into you own thing.

>"There isn't a move that's a new move." Kobe Bryant

Kobe stole a lot from his heroes, but he found out one thing; *They did not fully work*! This is because his heroes had different body types... So he **adapted** the moves to make it his own.

>"It is our failure to become our perceived ideal that ultimately defines us and makes us *unique*." Conan O'Brien

#### Good Theft v/s Bad Theft

![[good theft vs bad theft.jpg | 500]]

>"I have stolen all of these moves from all these great players. I just try to do them proud, the guys who came before, because I learned so much from them. It's all in the name of the game. It's a lot bigger than me." Kobe Bryant

If this man has "*stolen*"; then why wouldn't you!

## Chapter 3: Write the Book You Want To Read

<h3>Write What You <s>Know</s> <ins>Like</ins></h3>

>The question every young writer at some point ask is: "*What should I write?*" And the standard answer is, "*Write what you know*". This advice always leads to **terrible** stories in which *nothing interesting happens*

>"My interest in making music has been to create something that does not exist that I would like to listen to. I wanted to hear music that had not yet happened, by putting together things that suggested a new thing which did not yet exist." Brian Eno

- The best advice is **not** to write what you *know*, it's to write what you *like*

>Go make **that** stuff!

### The Manifesto

>[!info]- What is Manifesto?
>A public declaration of policy and aims, especially one issued before an election by a political party or candidate.

You need to do the things you **love**, the drawings that **you** want to *draw*, the *games* that **you** want to play

- Do the work you want to see done

>"*Like right now, I am typing these notes, because I think it is fun!*"

## Chapter 4: Use Your Hands

>"We don't know where we get our ideas from. What we do know is that we *do not get them from our **laptops***." John Cleese

### Step Away From The Screen ( *oh shit* 👀 )

>"In the digital age, don't forget to use your digits ( *hands* )" Lynda Barry

>"You never really get to touch anything that you're doing unless you **print it out**" Stanley Donwood

<p align="center" style="color: red">Sitting in from of a computer all day is <strong>killing your work</strong></p>

<p align="center" style="color: red">Work that <strong>only</strong> from the head isn't good!</p>

>"*That is why I bought a tablet* and will be **writing my notes** in university"

>"I have started long enough at then glowing flat rectangle of computer screens. Let us give more time for doing things in the real world... plant a plant, walk the dogs, read a book ( *physical books that I want to read are **not** available in my fucking country* ), go to the opera" Edward Tufte

>"In the old days before creative writing programs, a workshop was a place, often a basement, where you sawed or hammered, drilled or planed something." Kay Ryan

As Brian Kiteley says: "*a light, airy room full of tools and raw materials where most of the work is hands-on*"

- The computer is really good for **editing** your *ideas* and publishing it to the real world.
- *Though* it is **not** *really good* for idea **generation**
	- Because it gives too many options and opportunities to **hit the delete key**
		- You can Neovim or even Obsidian with minimal plugins and pour down your thoughts
	- But in today's world of *AI*; I think this is debatable
	- Nevertheless, I do agree with him

	The thing about the delete key is very true; and that is why [Van Neistat](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5mPJA4y5G8Z6aNkY6AxgAw) in his video [Manual Typewriter vs. The Computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iViMlNj_Ca4&t=365s) the typewriter will **capture** your voice. That is the reason to use **analog tools** for the *generation of ideas* process

<p align="center">Unlike a hard drive; <strong>paper</strong> does not <em>crash</em>!</p>

<p align="center" style="color: red">The Computer brings our the <em>uptight</em> perfectionist in us</p>

>"*Look at the thing that I am doing right now; typing up the notes that has **already** been written and I am just making a nice more "compiled" version; so that it can be shared and long-lasting*"

Tom Gauld ( *talks about the computer in his workflow* ):

>"things are inevitable path to being finished. Whereas in my sketchbook the possibilities are endless"

### How to Be Both Analog and Digital

>[!warning]- This is a stretch for most people but still...
>Even for me; this is technically possible;
>- Like I have 2 separate desk:
>	1. PC Desk
>	2. "*Writing*" / "*Homework*" desk
>
>But I do use my tablet in my "*writing*" desk

#### Austin Kleon's Desk Setup

![[analog and digital workspace.jpg]]

## Chapter 5: Side Projects and Hobbies are Important

<p align="center" style="color: green">"The work you do while you <strong>procrastinate</strong> is probably the work you should be doing for the rest of your life." Jessica Hische</p>

### Practice | Productive | Procrastination

>"By side project I mean the stuff that you thought was just messing around... **That's actually the good stuff**"

- We need to have multiple *side projects* so that we can bounce off from one project to another

What he means by "*bouncing off*" is that we can **avoid** *procrastination* by switching from one project to another!

>"*When I get busy, I get stupid*" Austin's coworker

- Creative people need time to just sit around and do nothing!

>"Avoiding work is the way to focus my mind" Maira Kalman

- But that does not mean that we should be spending time on our phone watching memes about planets ( *a.k.a fat people* )

### Don't Throw Any Of Yourself Away

>"You can't connect the dos looking forward, you can only connect them by looking backwards" Steve Jobs

![[do not leave your longings.jpg]]

<p align="center" style="color: green">A <em>hobby</em> is something that <strong>gives</strong> but does not take</p>

## Chapter 6: The Secret: Do Good Work and *Share* It With People

### In The Beginning, Obscurity Is Good

- We will realise that most people in the world do not care about our thoughts and ideas
	- It sounds harsh, but it's **true**

>"It's not that people are mean or cruel, they're just busy." Steven Pressfield

This is a good thing; because as people do not really care about what you are doing. You can fully **focus** on your and *only* your work!

<p align="center" style="color: green;">You can do whatever you want when you are <strong>unknown</strong>.<em>Experiment. Do things for the fun of it!</em></p>

- When you're **unknown**, there's nothing to distract you from getting better!

<p align="center" style="color: red;">You will <strong>never</strong> get the <em>freedom</em> back again once people start paying you attention and <strong>especially</strong> not once they start paying you <em>money</em></p>

>"Enjoy your obscurity while it lasts. **Use it**"

### The NOT-SO-Secret Formula

- Do **good** work and **share** it with people

#### It's 2 Step Process

>[!note] Work, Work, Work
>1. Do Good Work
>	- It is very very very difficult; There are no shortcuts
>	>[!tip] Learn, Fail, Get Better, Repeat
>	>Make stuff everyday and fail at it. Then learn it, make projects do stuff. Learn things that you never heard of.
>	>>"a lot of those people are doing in science is not that hard... **everybody** can do science if you have the curiosity, you can go ask people question and figure out the answers and connect the dots" [Aella - On Lex Fridman's Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFSrxSBrgSc&t=343s)
>	>>- Meaning you can pretty much learn if you put your "*heart*" and "*head*" into it
>	
>2. Share It
>- Sharing stuff is very **easy** today. We have social medias, we have forums and more. Thus, instead of posting your fucking face online, post your work. 

>[!tip] STEPS
>1. Wonder at something
>2. Invite others ( *other like-minded people* )
>>[!note] Wonder about things that nobody else is wondering about.
>>- The more **open** you are about sharing your passions, the closer people will feel to your work

<p align="center" style="color: green">People <strong>love</strong> it when you <strong>give</strong> your <em>secrets</em> away!</p>

You go online not only because you have something to say, but you can indeed put yourself online to **find** something to say.

Being online is like getting kicked in the arse ( *we are civilised savages here* 🤣 ) .

Most websites and blogs are setup to show posts in *reverse-chronological order*; i.e the latest posts are at the top of the page. This means that **you are only good as your *last* post**.

This keeps you on your toes, keeps you thinking about what you can post next. Having a *container* can inspire us to fill it

![[life cycle of a project.jpg]]

>[!info] Learn and Do these things $\downarrow$
>Learn to code a website or blog. Figure Twitter out. Find people on the internet and connect with them. Share things with them.

>[!tip] Remember
><p align="center" style="color: white">You have <strong>control</strong> over what you share and how much you reveal</p>

>"Don't worry about people stealing your ideas. If you ideas are any good, you'll have to ram them down people's throats." Howard Aiken

## Chapter 7: Geography is No Longer Our Master

### Build Your Own World

>"I'd say that 90% of my mentors and peers don't live in Austin, Texas. They live ***everywhere***. I know them from the Internet."

- Surround yourself with books and objects that you love. Tape things up on the wall. *Create your own world* ( *that you would like to see* )

>"It isn't necessary that you leave home. Sit at your desk and listen. Don't even listen, just wait. Don't wait, be still and alone. The whole world will offer itself to you." Franz Kafka

>"I always carry a book, a pen, and a notepad, and I always enjoy my solitude and temporary captivity"

Yeah, I have this rule also; **NO PHONE** when going outside; nevertheless, I do not carry a notepad and pen with me. But I need to. There are many times where I needed to write something down but couldn't. Well you might be asking, "*Why don't you use your phone*", well... 1. You have to unlock it 2. Go into the app 3. Start typing and if you have **sweaty hands** like me. Good luck trying that in a few seconds.

### Leave Home

>"Distance and difference are the secret tonic of creativity. When we get home, home is still the same. But something in our mind has been changed, and that changes everything." Jonah Lehrer

- Your brain gets too comfortable in your everyday surrounding. You need to make it uncomfortable

>"*How do you it uncomfortable? CHANGE*"

Travel makes the world look new, and when it looks new, our brains works harder.

## Chapter 8: Be Nice ( *The World Is A Small Town* )

### Make Friends, Ignore Enemies

>"There's only one reason I'm here: I'm here to make friends."

- The best way to vanquish your enemies on the Internet? **Ignore them**
- The best way to make friends on the Internet? **Say nice things about them**

>"There's only one rule I know of: You've got to be kind." Kurt Vonnegut

### Stand Next To The Talent

>[!info]- What is Mofo?
>Slang, mainly in US short for taboo word 'motherfucker'

>"The only mofos in my circle are people that I can learn from." Questlove

>"*I am looking at you right now, You know who you are; you guys are the best*"

>[!info] What You Need
>![[what do you need to steal.jpg | 640]]

<p align="center" style="color: green">"If you ever find that you are the most talented person in the room, you need to find another room."</p>

### "Quit Picking Fights and Go Make Something."

You will see a lot of things that stupid on the Internet and you will want to correct it. But don't waste your time, there are better things to do.

>"One time I was up late on my laptop and my wife yelled at me, "Quit picking fights on Twitter and go make something!

- So go on, get angry, But keep your mouth shut and go do your work.

>"*Anger is good but you have to use it in a "good" way*"

>"Complain about the way other people make software by making software" Andre Torrez

>"*Oh shit* 🥶"

### Write Fan Letters

>"The best way to get approval is to not need it" Austin's friend Hugh MacLeod

- The most important thing is that you show your appreciation without expecting anything in return and that you get new work of the appreciation.

### Validation Is For Parking

>"Modern art = I could do that + Yeah, but you didn't." Craig Damrauer

- Ironically, really good work often appears to be effortless.
	- People will say, "*Why didn't I think of that?*" They won't see the years of toil and sweat that went into it.
- So get comfortable with being misunderstood, disparaged, or ignored
	- The trick is to be too busy doing your work to care

## Chapter 9: Being Boring ( It's The Only Way To Get Work Done )

>"Be regular and orderly in your life, so that you may be violent and original in your work." Gustave Flaubert

### Take Care of Yourself

>"It takes a lot of energy to be creative"

>Neil Young sang, "It's better to burn out than to fade away."

Austin says: "*It's better to burn slow and see your grandkids*"

### Stay Out of Debt

>"Most people I know hate to think about money. **Do yourself a favor: Learn about money as soon as you can**"

>"*Especially in this piece of shit corrupted country*"

My grandpa used to tell my dad, "*Son, it's not the money you make, it's the money you hold on to*"

- Make yourself a budget
- Live within your means
- Pack your lunch
- Pinch Pennies
- Save as much as you can
- Get the education you need for as cheap as you can get it

The art of holding on to money is all about saying not to consumer culture. Saying no to takeout, $4 lattes, and that shiny new computer when the old one still works fine.

>"*Whatever you have ( clothing, tools, car, computer, etc ) is the only thing you need until they actually break*"
>*In fact, I say that the worst the tool you have and master it, when it is time to get better tools, you will be on top of everyone else.*

### Keep Your Day Job

- A day job gives you money, a connection to the world, and a routine.

>"If you don't take money, they can't tell you what to do." Bill Cunningham

<p align="center" style="color: red">Establishing and keeping a routine can be even more important than having a lot of time</p>

- Do the work everyday, not matter what. No holidays, no sick days. Don't stop
- [Parkinson's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law) is usually true: Work gets done in the time available


### Some tips

#### Get Yourself a Calendar

- A calendar will help you plan your work, give you concrete goals, and keeps you on track.
  >"Get a calendar. Fill the boxes. Don't break the chain."
  
#### Keep a Logbook

The logbook is not a *bullet journal* per se. But a book in which you list what you did today. **Much easier than keeping a detail diary**

- In the old days, a logbook was a place for sailors to keep track of how far they'd traveled, and that's exactly what you're doing - **Keeping track of how far *your* ship has sailed**

>"If you ask yourself 'What's the best thing that happened today?; it actually forces a certain kind of cheerful retrospection that pulls up from the recent past things to writer about that you wouldn't otherwise think about. If you ask yourself 'What happened today?' it's very likely that you're going to remember the worst thing, because you've had to deal with it - you've had to rush somewhere or somebody said something mean to you - that's what you're going to remember. But if you ask what the best thing is, it's going to be some particular slant of light, or some wonderful expression somebody had, or some particular delicious salad." Nicholson Baker

##### Austin's Logbook Example

![[log book.jpg]]

#### Marry Well

>"She rescued me. I'd be playing in a steak house right now if it wasn't for her. I wouldn't even be playing in a steak house. I'd be cooking in a steak house" Tom Waits, on his wife and collaborator, Kathleen Brennan

- Who you marry is **THE MOST IMPORTANT** decision you'll ever make.
	- . And “marry well” doesn’t just mean your life partner—it also means who you do business with, who you befriend, who you choose to be around. Relationships are hard enough, but it takes a real champion of a person to be married to someone who’s obsessed with a creative pursuit. Lots of times you have to be a maid, a cook, a motivational speaker, a mother, and an editor—all at once
- A good partner keeps you grounded.
	- A friend once remarked that living with an artist must make our house very inspiring. My wife joked, "Oh yeah, it's like living with da Vinci." She's the best
