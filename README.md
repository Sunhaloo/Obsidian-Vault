# My Obsidian Backup Branch

This is the place/branch/folder where I use GitHub to backup my Obsidian files.
These files are *markdown files* which are used everywhere on the Intenet like;

- GitHub
- Websites
- Books
- Technical Documentations

I hope that you can also use my notes if you need to.
