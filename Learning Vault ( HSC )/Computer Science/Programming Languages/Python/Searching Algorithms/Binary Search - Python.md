# What is Binary Search?

In simple terms it is just a [[Python Data View#Searching Algorithms| searching algorithm]] that will **find** the required *data* in an **sorted** array.

The **calculation** part works like this:

1. It find the **middle** of the array
	- This is done by finding the **average** of the *length* of the array
2. If the middle value is the one that we are looking for;
	- We then output the **location** / **address** of the value
3. If the middle value is **less** than the search value
	- It will **increase** the *lower bound*
	- Thus, cutting half of the **lower** part of the array
4. If the middle value is **greater** than the search value
	- It will **decrease** the *upper bound*
	- Thus, cutting half of the **upper** part of the array

This means that **binary search** is really *efficient* and *fast*, as it always **cuts** the array in half each time the value is **not** found.

# Some Advantages

- Run time complexity if 0 ( $log N$ )
- Very fast and efficient for large data sets
	- As is cuts the array in half

# Some Disadvantages

- It is error prone
	- *Off-By-One Errors*
		- Occurs when determining the boundary of the next interval
- Caching is poor

> For more advantages and disadvantages; just [Google](https://google.com) them. The thing is that you need to know is:
> - Understand how it works
> - The actually program code

>[!warning]
>The array needs to be **SORTED** for it to work
>Never forget this.

# Binary Search Code - 1D Array

## Template - 1D Array

This is only the [[Functions and Procedures - Python#Example 5 Binary Search| function]], thus is will **not** run on its own.

```python

# Binary Search Function

# We need to pass 2 arguments inside the function

# We need to pass the array - In this case our array is called "array"
# We need to pass our search value - In this case our array is called "user_find"
def binary_search(array, user_find):

    # Another function what will perform the calculations for the binary search
    
    # In this function we need to pass the:
    # array
    # Mininum size of array = 0
    # length of array - 1
    # search value ( user_find )
    return binary_search_calc(array, 0, len(array) - 1, user_find)
  
# Our function "binary_search_calc()" will perform the calculations

# In this function we need to pass some values for;
# array
# Minimum siz of array = 0 --> "lower" 
# length of array - 1 --> "upper"
# search value ( user_find )
def binary_search_calc(array, lower, upper, user_find):

    # Condition to enter loop ( need to learn theory to understand why )
    while lower <= upper:

        # Calculating our mid value
        mid = (lower + upper) // 2

        # If value at index "mid" is equal to search value ( user_find )
        if array[mid] == user_find:

            return mid

        # If value at index "mid" is lower than search value ( user_find )
        elif array[mid] < user_find:

            # lower takes the index to the right of mid
            # Remove the "lower" part of array
            lower = mid + 1

        else:

            # upper takes the index to the left of mid
            # Remove the "upper" part of array
            upper = mid - 1
            
    # If "user_find" is not found
    return -1

```

# If the result was not equal to False

    print(str(user_find) + " has been found at " + str(result))

else:
