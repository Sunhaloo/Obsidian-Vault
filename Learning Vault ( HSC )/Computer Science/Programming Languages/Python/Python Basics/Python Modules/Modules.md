# What is a Module?

In simple terms, there are the normal python files ( "*.py*" ); these python files contains codes that can be imported inside another Python Program ( "*I consider them a bit like a dependency*" ).

## Built-In Modules

These are files that are already present upon the installation of Python.
There are many built-in functions in Python. To see all the available modules in Python, type the following in the Python shell or using Terminal ( Python in the terminal directly )

```python

# Modules

help('modules')

```

# Random Module

This is pretty much a module that allows the user to manipulate "*random numbers*" in a program.
